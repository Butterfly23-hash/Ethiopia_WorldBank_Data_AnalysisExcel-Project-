# Ethiopia_WorldBank_Data_AnalysisExcel-Project-
Analysis of Ethiopia’s key economic indicators from 2010 to 2023 using World Bank data. Includes insights on GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, government finances.

In this project, I analyzed Ethiopia’s key economic indicators from 2010 to 2023 using World Bank data.

I started by importing the dataset from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishksharma9905/global-economic-indicators-20102025

After importing the data, I filtered it to focus only on Ethiopia. I then cleaned and standardized the data to make it ready for analysis.

Next, I performed statistical analysis on key indicators such as GDP, inflation, unemploymet . I calculated yearly averages, growth rates. 

Finally, I created charts  to help show the key patterns and insights. These visual tools highlight Ethiopia’s economic growth, inflation trends, government revenue changes. 

Detailed Insights

Between 2010 and 2023, Ethiopia experienced economic growth. GDP rose from about 30 billion dollars to over 163 billion dollars. GDP per capita also increased, showing improved average income levels. However, inflation rose over the years and reached more than 30 percent in recent times. This made the cost of living harder for many people. Unemployment stayed low, mostly between 2 and 4 percent, which shows a stable job market despite economic challenges.

GDP growth was decreasing , ranging from 12% in 2010 to 6% percent in 2023 with average Gdp growth about 8%. Inflation based on the GDP deflator changed a lot and went above 33 percent in some years. The current account balance was always negative, meaning the country imported more than it exported. Over time, government spending, revenue and tax revenue as a share of GDP went down. This may show changes in fiscal policy or the structure of the economy.

Gross National Income (GNI) grew from about 29.8 billion dollars in 2010 to over 163 billion dollars in 2023. But tax revenue as a percent of GDP fell from over 9 percent to under 4 percent. This may point to issues in tax collection or changes in policy.

On average from 2010 to 2023, Ethiopia had a yearly GDP growth rate of 8.66 percent and GDP averaged nearly 80 billion dollars. GDP per capita improved and averaged around 707 dollars. Inflation stayed high and changed often. CPI inflation averaged 17.66 percent and GDP deflator inflation averaged 16.56 percent. These high rates probably affected how affordable goods and services are. Unemployment stayed low and stable at about 2.8 percent.

 According to my Analysis Ethiopia had a negative current account balance that averaged -5.94 percent of GDP. This shows the country relied a lot on imports. Government expenses averaged 9.56 percent of GDP. Government revenue averaged 8.69 percent and tax revenue was around 7.3 percent. This shows a gap between spending and income and may mean the government had trouble collecting enough revenue.

Overall, the data shows strong growth in Gdp in Ethiopia but also high inflation and some fiscal challenges.
